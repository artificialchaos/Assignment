# Assignment
Data visualization assignment

My aim for this project is to make interactive visual representaions of the change is oil prices over time.

Some features I'm working on implementing are:


-make a projection for the increase in oil prices in the future based on my data set.


-represent the the prices per barrel relative to average income at the time.


-A feature where the user specifies car engine size + date and the program returns how much it would have cost to fill up their  car at that time.
